1. VOCABULARY SELECTION APPROACH (Replace current vocabulary guidelines):

VOCABULARY SELECTION APPROACH:
First, analyze what vocabulary is appropriate for ${params.cefrLevel} level:
- Research the vocabulary range typical for ${params.cefrLevel} level students
- Consider both receptive and productive vocabulary expectations
- Determine which semantic fields are appropriate at this level
- Identify vocabulary selection criteria specific to this level (frequency, complexity, abstractness)

Based on your analysis, establish guidelines for:
- Appropriate vocabulary difficulty/complexity 
- How to define words at this level (simple definitions for A1/A2, more nuanced for B2+)
- Appropriate example sentence complexity
- Word family relationships appropriate to introduce
- Collocation complexity appropriate for this level

2. SENTENCE FRAMES APPROACH (Replace current sentence frames structure):

SENTENCE FRAMES APPROACH:
First, analyze what sentence patterns are appropriate for ${params.cefrLevel} level:
- Research the syntactic structures typically taught at ${params.cefrLevel} level
- Identify high-frequency, versatile sentence patterns used in authentic contexts
- Determine appropriate complexity of explanations for this level
- Consider how the patterns should be presented and practiced

Then, based on your analysis:
- Design 1-2 sentence patterns that are:
  a) Appropriate for ${params.cefrLevel} level complexity
  b) Genuinely useful in everyday communication
  c) Relevant to the lesson topic
  d) Structured in a way students can easily understand and practice

For each pattern, determine the most appropriate way to:
- Present the pattern visually
- Break it down into comprehensible components
- Provide level-appropriate examples
- Create practice opportunities
- Guide teachers in presenting it effectively

3. READING COMPREHENSION APPROACH (Replace current cognitive levels structure):

READING COMPREHENSION APPROACH:
First, analyze appropriate comprehension skills for ${params.cefrLevel} level:
- Research reading comprehension expectations at ${params.cefrLevel} level
- Identify appropriate question types for this level (literal, inferential, evaluative)
- Determine text-dependent question strategies suited to this level
- Consider appropriate cognitive challenges that remain accessible

Then, based on your analysis:
- Create 3-5 comprehension questions that:
  a) Assess understanding at appropriate depths for ${params.cefrLevel}
  b) Use question formats appropriate for this level
  c) Progress from more straightforward to more challenging
  d) Require different reading skills (locating information, making connections, drawing conclusions)
  e) Provide appropriate scaffolding for students at this level
