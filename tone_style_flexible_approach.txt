TONE & STYLE APPROACH:
First, analyze appropriate tone and style considerations for ${params.cefrLevel} level:
- Research how tone and register should be adjusted for ${params.cefrLevel} level learners
- Identify appropriate language complexity, sentence structure, and vocabulary choices for this level
- Determine the optimal balance between authenticity and accessibility
- Consider how the topic "${params.topic}" influences appropriate tone and style
- Analyze engagement strategies that work best for this proficiency level and topic

Based on your analysis, develop a tone and style that:
- Is most effective for ${params.cefrLevel} level language comprehension
- Creates appropriate engagement for the specific topic "${params.topic}"
- Balances authenticity with accessibility
- Models natural language use appropriate to the context
- Demonstrates appropriate register for both the topic and level
- Provides appropriate linguistic scaffolding through style choices
- Creates interest and motivation for continued reading/learning

Apply your determined tone and style consistently across all lesson components:
- Reading text
- Vocabulary definitions and examples
- Activity instructions
- Discussion questions and contexts
- Teacher guidance sections
