STEP 0: CEFR LEVEL ANALYSIS (REQUIRED BEFORE PROCEEDING)

Before creating any lesson content, first analyze and establish clear parameters for what constitutes ${params.cefrLevel} level appropriate content:

1. VOCABULARY ANALYSIS:
   - Identify what vocabulary range is appropriate for ${params.cefrLevel} level students
   - List 5-10 example words that would be appropriate for this level
   - List 3-5 example words that would be too difficult for this level

2. GRAMMAR STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:
   - Identify which grammatical structures are appropriate for ${params.cefrLevel} level
   - List 3-5 sentence structure patterns appropriate for this level
   - List 2-3 grammatical structures that would be too complex for this level

3. TEXT COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
   - Determine appropriate sentence length and complexity for ${params.cefrLevel} level
   - Identify appropriate paragraph structure and length
   - Establish appropriate use of idioms, phrasal verbs, and figurative language (if any)

4. COGNITIVE DEMAND ANALYSIS:
   - Identify appropriate cognitive tasks for ${params.cefrLevel} level (describing, explaining, comparing, etc.)
   - Determine appropriate level of abstraction for concepts
   - Assess appropriate cultural knowledge assumptions

Spend time establishing these parameters before proceeding. This analysis will guide your creation of all lesson components to ensure they remain appropriate for ${params.cefrLevel} level students throughout.

Once complete, use these self-generated guidelines to create appropriately leveled content for all components of the lesson.
