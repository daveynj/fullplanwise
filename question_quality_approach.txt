QUESTION QUALITY IMPROVEMENT APPROACH:
First, analyze what constitutes high-quality questions for ${params.cefrLevel} level:
- Research question taxonomies (Bloom's, DOK) appropriate for this level
- Identify question types that stimulate meaningful language production
- Determine markers of high-quality vs. low-quality questions
- Study question formulation techniques used by expert language teachers

For discussion questions, ensure each question:
- Has clear purpose and language learning objectives
- Elicits more than one-word or yes/no responses
- Connects to students' experiences while remaining culturally inclusive
- Builds on vocabulary/concepts from the lesson
- Avoids vague, obvious, or simplistic formulations ("What did it look like?")
- Encourages critical thinking appropriate to the level
- Is genuinely interesting to discuss

For comprehension questions, ensure each question:
- Tests specific comprehension skills appropriate for ${params.cefrLevel}
- Requires genuine understanding rather than just recognizing words
- Progresses from literal to interpretive to applied understanding
- Focuses on meaningful content rather than trivial details
- Uses question stems appropriate for the cognitive level
- Avoids ambiguity or multiple possible correct answers

Apply these quality standards to generate questions that:
- Engage students intellectually at their appropriate level
- Provide meaningful language practice opportunities
- Demonstrate careful thought and authentic curiosity
- Serve clear pedagogical purposes
- Would be asked by experienced language educators
