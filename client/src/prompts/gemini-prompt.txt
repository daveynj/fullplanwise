// For sentence frames section, include these specific instructions:

For the sentence frames section, create teaching-focused content that helps teachers present useful language patterns found in the reading. Each frame must:

1. Be directly extracted from the reading passage (use actual sentences from the text)
2. Focus on structures that help students discuss the topic effectively
3. Include clear teaching guidance for classroom instruction

For each sentence frame, follow this exact structure:

```
{
  "pattern": "[clear pattern with placeholders in {curly braces}]",
  "title": "Short descriptive name",
  "description": "When/how to use this pattern functionally",
  "readingExample": "Direct quote from the reading using this pattern",
  "readingParagraph": "Number or brief identifier of paragraph containing example",
  
  "examples": [
    {
      "text": "Example sentence using pattern and lesson vocabulary",
      "source": "reading", 
      "highlightPattern": true
    },
    {
      "text": "Another example sentence",
      "source": "custom",
      "highlightPattern": true
    }
  ],
  
  "components": [
    {
      "name": "Part name (Subject, Verb, etc.)",
      "description": "Clear explanation of this component's function",
      "examples": ["Example word/phrase for this component"]
    }
  ],
  
  "teachingTips": [
    {
      "tip": "Concrete teaching suggestion, error prevention, or usage note",
      "type": "error"
    },
    {
      "tip": "Additional classroom guidance",
      "type": "usage"
    }
  ],
  
  "practiceSuggestions": [
    "Brief, actionable classroom activity to practice this pattern",
    "Another practice activity suggestion"
  ],
  
  "discussionPrompts": [
    "Prompt connecting this pattern to one of the discussion questions",
    "Another prompt for classroom use"
  ]
}
```

Create exactly 3-5 sentence frames, prioritizing patterns that:
1. Actually appear in the reading text
2. Are most useful for discussing the topic
3. Represent different grammatical structures (don't use all the same pattern)
4. Progress from simpler to more complex structures

Ensure each pattern has real examples from the reading text and uses vocabulary from the lesson vocabulary list.
