// For sentence frames, add the following detailed instructions:

When generating sentence frames for the lesson, focus on creating teaching-focused materials that directly connect to the reading passage. Each frame should have:

1. A clear pattern with a descriptive title and purpose.
2. Direct connections to the reading passage by extracting examples that use this pattern.
3. 3-5 additional teaching examples using vocabulary from the lesson.
4. A structure breakdown explaining each component of the pattern.
5. 2-3 practical teaching tips (including common errors, usage notes).
6. 2-3 classroom practice suggestions.
7. Discussion prompts that use the pattern and connect to the discussion questions.

For each sentence frame, use this structure:
```json
{
  "pattern": "[pattern with placeholders like {subject} {verb} {object}]",
  "title": "Brief descriptive title",
  "description": "Explanation of when/how to use this pattern",
  "readingExample": "Example sentence from the reading that uses this pattern",
  "examples": [
    {
      "text": "Complete example sentence",
      "source": "reading or custom", 
      "highlightPattern": true
    }
  ],
  "components": [
    {
      "name": "Component name (e.g., Subject, Verb)",
      "description": "What this component does/means",
      "examples": ["Example1", "Example2"]
    }
  ],
  "teachingTips": [
    {
      "tip": "Teaching tip content",
      "type": "error, usage, cultural, or general"
    }
  ],
  "practiceSuggestions": [
    "Classroom activity suggestion"
  ],
  "discussionPrompts": [
    "Discussion prompt using this pattern"
  ]
}
```

Limit to 3-5 key sentence patterns that are most useful for discussing the reading topic. Each pattern should actually appear in the reading passage.
