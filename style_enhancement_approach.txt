ENHANCED STYLE APPROACH:
First, analyze writing style characteristics of exemplary language teaching materials:
- Study highly engaging ESL materials at ${params.cefrLevel} level
- Identify what makes certain materials more engaging than others
- Research the balance between authenticity and accessibility
- Determine style patterns that increase student motivation and interest

Based on your analysis, develop a writing style for "${params.topic}" at ${params.cefrLevel} level that:
- Has a clear, consistent voice throughout the lesson
- Uses language patterns that model natural, native-like expression
- Incorporates appropriate humor, warmth, or formality based on topic and level
- Avoids "textbook language" that feels artificial or overly simplified
- Creates genuine interest through vivid, specific language
- Uses varied sentence structures appropriate for the level
- Maintains an authentic voice while remaining level-appropriate

Avoid these common stylistic issues:
- Generic, predictable phrasing that feels template-based
- Overly formal academic tone when inappropriate for the topic
- Overly simple language that doesn't challenge students appropriately
- Inconsistent voice across different sections
- Repetitive sentence structures or vocabulary
- Awkward phrasing that doesn't reflect how native speakers express ideas

Instead, create content with:
- Natural flow and cohesion between ideas
- Appropriate contextual examples that feel relevant and contemporary
- Language that demonstrates personality and engagement with the topic
- A balance of concrete and abstract concepts appropriate to the level
- Stylistic choices that would engage adult learners intellectually
