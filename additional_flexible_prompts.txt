1. DISCUSSION QUESTIONS APPROACH (Replace current discussion question requirements):

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS APPROACH:
First, analyze effective discussion questions for ${params.cefrLevel} level students:
- Research effective questioning techniques for ${params.cefrLevel} level language learners
- Identify appropriate cognitive challenge levels for discussions at this level
- Determine the balance between scaffolding and open-ended questioning
- Consider how background/context should be provided at this level
- Analyze how to encourage extended responses from students at this proficiency level

Based on your analysis, create discussion questions that:
- Match the cognitive abilities of ${params.cefrLevel} level students
- Provide appropriate contextual support based on level needs
- Encourage critical thinking appropriate to this level
- Are designed for optimal language production at this level
- Connect to both the lesson content and students' experiences
- Progress from more supported to more independent thinking

2. WARM-UP ACTIVITIES APPROACH (Replace current warm-up activity requirements):
