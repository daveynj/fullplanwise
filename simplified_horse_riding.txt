Hobbies: Horse Riding

It is a sunny morning. You go to the stable where the horses live. You can smell hay and horses. Your horse sees you and makes a happy sound. You are ready to ride.

First, you check the saddle and all the equipment. Everything must be safe for you and your horse. Then, you take your horse out of the stable to the riding area.

You start by walking with your horse. You get used to how the horse moves. Then you try to go faster, which is called trotting. The horse's feet make a nice sound on the ground. Later, you can try to go even faster. This is very fun, and you feel the wind in your hair.

Horse riding is not just about going fast. It is also about quiet time with your horse. You brush your horse, walk slowly in fields, and become friends with your horse.

If you are new to horse riding or if you have done it for a long time, it is a special hobby. You can enjoy nature, try new things, and make a good friend - your horse.
