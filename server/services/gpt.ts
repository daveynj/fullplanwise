  - Discussion questions and contexts
  - Teacher guidance sections

TOPIC DIFFERENTIATION APPROACH:
First, analyze how the topic "${params.topic}" should be treated differently across CEFR levels:
- Research how the complexity and focus of topic treatment evolves from A1 to C2
- Identify specific aspects of the topic appropriate for ${params.cefrLevel} level
- Determine which vocabulary domains within this topic are level-appropriate
- Consider how conceptual complexity should increase with higher levels

For "${params.topic}" at ${params.cefrLevel} level specifically:
- Identify 3-5 unique aspects or sub-topics that are specifically appropriate for this level
- Determine which vocabulary domains are appropriate for THIS level but NOT lower levels
- Consider which cognitive approaches to the topic match this specific level
- Identify conceptual complexity appropriate specifically for ${params.cefrLevel}

Based on your analysis, create a unique approach to "${params.topic}" for ${params.cefrLevel} level by:
- Focusing on the sub-aspects most appropriate for this specific level
- Selecting vocabulary that would NOT be taught at lower levels
- Approaching the topic from a cognitive perspective matching this level
- Ensuring clear differentiation from how this topic would be taught at other levels

This approach should ensure that lessons on the same topic at different CEFR levels are substantially different in:
- Vocabulary selection
- Question complexity and type
- Conceptual approach
- Content focus and examples

ENHANCED STYLE APPROACH:
First, analyze writing style characteristics of exemplary language teaching materials:
- Study highly engaging ESL materials at ${params.cefrLevel} level
- Identify what makes certain materials more engaging than others
- Research the balance between authenticity and accessibility
- Determine style patterns that increase student motivation and interest

Based on your analysis, develop a writing style for "${params.topic}" at ${params.cefrLevel} level that:
- Has a clear, consistent voice throughout the lesson
- Uses language patterns that model natural, native-like expression
- Incorporates appropriate humor, warmth, or formality based on topic and level
- Avoids "textbook language" that feels artificial or overly simplified
- Creates genuine interest through vivid, specific language
- Uses varied sentence structures appropriate for the level
- Maintains an authentic voice while remaining level-appropriate

Avoid these common stylistic issues:
- Generic, predictable phrasing that feels template-based
- Overly formal academic tone when inappropriate for the topic
- Overly simple language that doesn't challenge students appropriately
- Inconsistent voice across different sections
- Repetitive sentence structures or vocabulary
- Awkward phrasing that doesn't reflect how native speakers express ideas

Instead, create content with:
- Natural flow and cohesion between ideas
- Appropriate contextual examples that feel relevant and contemporary
- Language that demonstrates personality and engagement with the topic
- A balance of concrete and abstract concepts appropriate to the level
- Stylistic choices that would engage adult learners intellectually

QUESTION QUALITY IMPROVEMENT APPROACH:
First, analyze what constitutes high-quality questions for ${params.cefrLevel} level:
- Research question taxonomies (Bloom's, DOK) appropriate for this level
- Identify question types that stimulate meaningful language production
- Determine markers of high-quality vs. low-quality questions
- Study question formulation techniques used by expert language teachers

For discussion questions, ensure each question:
- Has clear purpose and language learning objectives
- Elicits more than one-word or yes/no responses
- Connects to students' experiences while remaining culturally inclusive
- Builds on vocabulary/concepts from the lesson
- Avoids vague, obvious, or simplistic formulations ("What did it look like?")
- Encourages critical thinking appropriate to the level
- Is genuinely interesting to discuss

For comprehension questions, ensure each question:
- Tests specific comprehension skills appropriate for ${params.cefrLevel}
- Requires genuine understanding rather than just recognizing words
- Progresses from literal to interpretive to applied understanding
- Focuses on meaningful content rather than trivial details
- Uses question stems appropriate for the cognitive level
- Avoids ambiguity or multiple possible correct answers

Apply these quality standards to generate questions that:
- Engage students intellectually at their appropriate level
- Provide meaningful language practice opportunities
- Demonstrate careful thought and authentic curiosity
- Serve clear pedagogical purposes
- Would be asked by experienced language educators
