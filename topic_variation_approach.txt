TOPIC DIFFERENTIATION APPROACH:
First, analyze how the topic "${params.topic}" should be treated differently across CEFR levels:
- Research how the complexity and focus of topic treatment evolves from A1 to C2
- Identify specific aspects of the topic appropriate for ${params.cefrLevel} level
- Determine which vocabulary domains within this topic are level-appropriate
- Consider how conceptual complexity should increase with higher levels

For "${params.topic}" at ${params.cefrLevel} level specifically:
- Identify 3-5 unique aspects or sub-topics that are specifically appropriate for this level
- Determine which vocabulary domains are appropriate for THIS level but NOT lower levels
- Consider which cognitive approaches to the topic match this specific level
- Identify conceptual complexity appropriate specifically for ${params.cefrLevel}

Based on your analysis, create a unique approach to "${params.topic}" for ${params.cefrLevel} level by:
- Focusing on the sub-aspects most appropriate for this specific level
- Selecting vocabulary that would NOT be taught at lower levels
- Approaching the topic from a cognitive perspective matching this level
- Ensuring clear differentiation from how this topic would be taught at other levels

This approach should ensure that lessons on the same topic at different CEFR levels are substantially different in:
- Vocabulary selection
- Question complexity and type
- Conceptual approach
- Content focus and examples
