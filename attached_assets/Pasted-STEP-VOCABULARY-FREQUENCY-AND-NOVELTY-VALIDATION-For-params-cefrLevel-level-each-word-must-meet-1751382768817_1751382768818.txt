STEP: VOCABULARY FREQUENCY AND NOVELTY VALIDATION
For ${params.cefrLevel} level, each word must meet these criteria. The aim is to introduce new, relevant vocabulary while ensuring a solid foundation.
 * A1 WORDS:
   * Primary Introduction: Must be within the top 1,000 most frequent English words.
   * Novelty Check: Prioritize words generally introduced at A1 or words that are essential for basic communication within the topic.
 * A2 WORDS:
   * Primary Introduction: Must be within the top 2,000 most frequent English words.
   * Novelty Check: Prioritize words generally introduced at A2, and avoid words primarily introduced at A1, unless their A2 usage is significantly more complex (e.g., a new phrasal verb using an A1 base verb).
 * B1 WORDS:
   * Primary Introduction: Must be within the top 3,000 most frequent English words.
   * Novelty Check: Prioritize words generally introduced at B1, and avoid words primarily introduced at A1 or A2, unless they are critical topic-specific vocabulary with a new B1 context or collocation.
 * B2 WORDS:
   * Primary Introduction: Can use words beyond the top 3,000, focusing on those typically introduced at B2.
   * Novelty Check: Prioritize words that are new to the B2 level for the given topic. Words from lower levels should only be included if they form part of a new, more complex B2-level phrase, collocation, or idiom, or are essential for abstract discussion.
   * Topic-Essential: Must be highly relevant and essential for understanding and discussing the specific topic at a B2 depth.
 * C1/C2 WORDS:
   * Primary Introduction: Focus on specialized, academic, formal, or nuanced vocabulary. Frequency is less of a strict constraint here.
   * Novelty Check: Prioritize words that are new to the C1/C2 level for the given topic, allowing for highly sophisticated and abstract terms.
   * Sophistication: Can include idiomatic expressions, advanced collocations, and words demonstrating a high level of lexical precision.
VALIDATION CHECK: Before including any word, verify:
"Is [word] appropriate for ${params.cefrLevel} considering its typical introduction level and novelty for this CEFR band?"
If NO, replace with a level-appropriate and novel alternative.
COGNITIVE APPROPRIATENESS CHECK:
Verify if students at ${params.cefrLevel} can not only comprehend but also productively engage with the word as expected for their level.
 * A1: Can students identify this word and use it in single-word or very short phrase responses in basic daily survival situations?
 * A2: Can students describe something simple using this word and participate in simple social interactions?
 * B1: Can students explain concepts in simple sentences, express personal opinions, or narrate simple events using this word in problem-solving discussions?
 * B2: Can students use this word in abstract discussions, support arguments, speculate, or evaluate situations?
 * C1/C2: Can students analyze nuanced meanings, synthesize information, present formal arguments, or discuss complex ethical dilemmas using this word?
REJECT if the word requires cognitive or productive abilities beyond the specified level's typical output.
COMMUNICATION CONTEXT CHECK:
Ensure the word's primary use-case aligns with the communication needs and contexts typical for ${params.cefrLevel}.
 * A1: Is this word predominantly used in basic daily survival situations (e.g., introductions, simple requests, personal information)?
 * A2: Is this word predominantly used in simple social interactions (e.g., describing routines, expressing simple likes/dislikes, making simple plans)?
 * B1: Is this word predominantly used in problem-solving discussions, for giving instructions, making comparisons, or expressing agreement/disagreement about familiar topics?
 * B2: Is this word predominantly used in opinion/argument contexts, for debating, persuading, or negotiating complex issues?
 * C1/C2: Is this word predominantly used in academic/professional contexts, for presenting formal arguments, critical analysis, or moderating discussions?
REJECT if the word's typical usage context doesn't match the student's communication needs at this level.
FOUNDATION VOCABULARY CHECK:
Before introducing a new word, ensure students are expected to know its prerequisite vocabulary.
 * Instruction: For each selected vocabulary item, explicitly identify 1-3 foundational words from preceding CEFR levels that are essential for understanding it.
 * Example: Before teaching "destination" (B1), students must know: "place" (A1), "go" (A1), "travel" (A2), "where" (A1).
 * Validation: If any prerequisite word is typically not known at a lower level, reconsider the target word's appropriateness or ensure the prerequisite is also introduced/recycled.
REJECT any word requiring unknown prerequisite vocabulary that cannot be easily inferred or quickly introduced.
LEVEL-SPECIFIC TOPIC VOCABULARY & NOVELTY FOCUS:
For the chosen topic (e.g., "Travel"), focus on providing new and challenging vocabulary for each CEFR level.
 * General Principle: The goal is to provide vocabulary that is fresh and appropriate for the current level, avoiding direct re-teaching of words primarily introduced at lower levels.
 * A1: Focus on fundamental, concrete words directly related to the topic for basic communication.
   * Examples for "Travel": plane, hotel, ticket, bag, passport, go, see.
 * A2: Focus on slightly more descriptive or action-oriented words related to the topic, expanding on A1 concepts.
   * Examples for "Travel": journey, tourist, vacation, culture, local, visit, stay, foreign.
 * B1: Focus on vocabulary for discussing experiences, plans, and more nuanced aspects of the topic.
   * Examples for "Travel": destination, experience, adventure, explore, traditional, organize, book, arrange.
 * B2: Focus on vocabulary for abstract discussions, opinions, and more complex aspects of the topic (e.g., ethical, environmental).
   * Examples for "Travel": itinerary, authentic, sustainable, perspective, immersive, impact, develop, consider.
 * C1: Focus on sophisticated, formal, or specialized vocabulary, including collocations and academic terms related to the topic.
   * Examples for "Travel": expedition, cosmopolitan, wanderlust, cultural immersion, heritage, preservation, undertake.
 * C2: Focus on highly specialized, nuanced, or idiomatic vocabulary for expert-level discussion and critical analysis.
   * Examples for "Travel": vernacular, peripatetic, cultural dialectics, arduous, discerning, profound.
VALIDATION: For each new level's topic vocabulary, ensure that:
 * Words are primarily introduced at that specific CEFR level or higher.
 * There is minimal to no overlap where a word primarily taught as "new" at a lower level is re-presented as "new" at a higher level for the same basic meaning. If a word appears across levels, it must be because it's used in a significantly more complex way, collocation, or nuanced meaning appropriate for the higher level (e.g., "go" (A1) vs. "undergo a transformation" (C1)).
