DISCUSSION QUESTION REQUIREMENTS:
- IMPORTANT NEW FORMAT: Each discussion question MUST be preceded by its own unique, CEFR-level appropriate paragraph (3-5 sentences) that provides context or an interesting angle related to the question. The question should directly relate to this paragraph.
- You MUST provide EXACTLY 5 such paragraph-question pairs.
- The paragraph should:
  - Be written at the appropriate CEFR level (${params.cefrLevel})
  - Focus on something interesting and thought-provoking related to the question topic
  - Create a foundation for meaningful discussion
  - Relate directly to the vocabulary being learned
  - Avoid simply summarizing the main reading
  - CRITICAL: The language complexity MUST match exactly the ${params.cefrLevel} level
  - Be designed to stand out visually when displayed in the UI
- The discussion question should:
  - Directly follow its context paragraph.
  - Be phrased as an interesting prompt that encourages different viewpoints
  - Include topics that could generate healthy debate between teacher and student
  - Range from simpler questions to more thought-provoking debates
  - Be appropriate for one-on-one teaching via screen sharing
  - Encourage use of the target vocabulary
  - Be designed for in-depth conversation, not just short answers
  - Reference specific content from both its context paragraph and the main reading

⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: You MUST provide EXACTLY 5 paragraph-question pairs. Failure to provide 5 pairs, each with a paragraph and a question, will cause your response to be rejected.

- Avoid generic questions - make them specific to the content and culturally relevant
- Adjust topic complexity appropriately for the target CEFR level
- Structure topics to build genuine discussion in a one-on-one context
- For each discussion question, include an image prompt (NEW!) - A detailed description (2-3 sentences) of what an image for this discussion topic should look like.
