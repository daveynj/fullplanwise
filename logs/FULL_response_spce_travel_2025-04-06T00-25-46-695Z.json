From ancient myths about the stars to modern rockets blasting off into the sky, humanity’s dream of reaching space has become a reality. Today, astronauts from different countries work together on missions that help us understand our universe better. For example, the International Space Station (ISS) orbits Earth and serves as a laboratory where scientists conduct experiments in zero gravity.\",\n\n        \"But why is space travel so challenging? One reason is gravity. To escape Earth’s pull, rockets must reach speeds of over 28,000 kilometers per hour! Once in space, astronauts experience weightlessness because there’s no gravity pulling them down. This can be fun but also tricky—for instance, eating and sleeping require special techniques.\",\n\nModern technology plays a huge role in making space travel possible. Satellites orbiting Earth provide communication services, weather forecasts, and even GPS navigation. Without these machines, life on Earth would look very different. Scientists are now working on new ways to make space travel safer and more efficient, such as reusable rockets and advanced propulsion systems.\",\n\n        \"Looking ahead, space agencies plan ambitious projects. Some aim to send humans to Mars, while others focus on mining asteroids for valuable resources. Imagine living on another planet someday—what would that be like?
