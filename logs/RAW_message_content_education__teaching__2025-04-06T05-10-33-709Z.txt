      "content": "In this warm-up, we will explore key vocabulary related to teaching methods in China. You'll learn words like 'curriculum,' 'discipline,' 'rote learning,' 'emphasis,' and 'classroom management.' These terms will help you understand the reading text better.",
      "questions": [
        "What do you think 'curriculum' means?",
        "Have you ever experienced 'rote learning' in your studies?",
        "Why is 'classroom management' important for teachers?",
        "How would you define 'discipline' in a school setting?",
        "What subjects might receive more 'emphasis' in schools?"
      ],
      "targetVocabulary": ["curriculum", "discipline", "rote learning", "emphasis", "classroom management"],
      "procedure": "Begin by asking students what they know about education systems in different countries. Introduce each vocabulary word with its definition and example sentence. Use visuals or real-life scenarios to make connections. For instance, show an image of students memorizing facts to explain 'rote learning.' Discuss how 'curriculum' guides what students learn, and ask them to share examples from their own experiences. Finally, create short role-plays where students use all five words in context.",
      "teacherNotes": "Encourage students to personalize their understanding of the vocabulary. Relate the terms to their educational backgrounds to build confidence before moving on to the reading."

      "introduction": "China has one of the oldest and most respected education systems in the world. Its teaching methods have evolved over centuries but still maintain some traditional practices. Let’s take a closer look at how classrooms operate and what makes Chinese education unique.",
      "paragraphs": [
        "In China, education is highly valued, and parents often place great emphasis on academic success. The national curriculum focuses on core subjects such as mathematics, science, and language arts. Teachers follow strict guidelines to ensure consistency across schools. This structured approach helps students develop strong foundational knowledge, which many believe contributes to China's high performance in international assessments.",
        "One common method used in Chinese classrooms is rote learning. Students are expected to memorize large amounts of information, especially in subjects like history and literature. While some critics argue that this method doesn't encourage creativity, supporters say it builds discipline and sharpens memory skills. Imagine sitting in a classroom where everyone chants the same passage together—it’s a scene you might find in many Chinese schools!",
        "Classroom management plays a crucial role in maintaining order during lessons. Teachers are seen as authority figures, and respect for them is deeply ingrained in the culture. Discipline is taken seriously, and disruptions are rare. In fact, students often stay quiet and focused, knowing that their behavior reflects not only on themselves but also on their families.",
        "Despite its traditional roots, China’s education system continues to evolve. There is growing emphasis on developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Some schools now incorporate group projects and interactive activities into their lessons. These changes aim to prepare students for modern challenges while preserving the strengths of traditional methods.",
        "So, what can we learn from China’s approach to education? Whether it’s the rigorous curriculum, the focus on discipline, or the balance between tradition and innovation, there’s much to admire. As global education trends shift, China remains a fascinating case study for educators worldwide."
