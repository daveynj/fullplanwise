For instance, explain that 'feudal' relates to a system where lords owned land and gave it to vassals. Ask students to repeat the words after you. Then, have them work in pairs to use each word in a sentence."

           "While most of us today live in modern cities, people in the Middle Ages lived very differently. The feudal system was the way society was organized. In this system, powerful lords owned large areas of land. They allowed vassals, who were lesser nobles, to live on and work their land in exchange for loyalty and military service. This arrangement helped keep order in a time when there were no strong central governments. Can you imagine living in such a structured world? It might feel strange to us now, but it worked for them.\\"
