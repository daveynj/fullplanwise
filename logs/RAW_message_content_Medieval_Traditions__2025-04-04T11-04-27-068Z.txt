      "procedure": "Start by introducing each word with its definition and an example sentence. Then, ask students to use each word in a sentence. For instance, 'Can you describe what a knight might do?' Next, show images that represent these words (e.g., a knight on horseback for 'knight'). Finally, play a quick matching game where students match the word to its definition.",

        "The medieval period, which lasted from the 5th to the late 15th century, was a time of castles, knights, and strict social rules. One of the most important systems was feudalism. In this system, kings gave land to lords, who then allowed peasants, called serfs, to work on their land. Serfs had few rights but were protected by their lords. This arrangement created a structured society where everyone had a role to play.\",\","
