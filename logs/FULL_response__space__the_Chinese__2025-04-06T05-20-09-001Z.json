Imagine being able to watch a live broadcast of a rocket launch—it’s truly amazing! Today, China operates many satellites that help with weather forecasting, communication, and even navigation systems like GPS.\",\n        \"One of the most impressive achievements came in 2003 when Yang Liwei became the first Chinese astronaut to travel to space. His mission lasted just over 21 hours, but it marked the beginning of China’s human spaceflight program. Astronauts undergo years of training before they can go on such important missions. They must be physically fit, mentally strong, and ready to face challenges in space.\",\n        \"In recent years, China has focused on exploring the Moon. In 2019, the Chang’e 4 spacecraft made history by landing on the far side of the Moon—a place no other country had reached before. Scientists hope to learn more about the Moon’s surface and possibly find resources that could benefit life on Earth. What do you think they might discover?\",\n        \"Looking ahead, China plans to build a permanent space station called Tiangong, which means 'Heavenly Palace.'
