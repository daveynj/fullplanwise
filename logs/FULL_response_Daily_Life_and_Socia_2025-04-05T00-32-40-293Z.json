One person shakes your hand firmly, another gives you a quick hug, and yet another bows slightly. Each of these actions is a custom—a tradition passed down through generations. While handshakes are common in many Western countries, bows are often used in places like Japan as a sign of respect. These gestures might seem small, but they carry deep meaning.\",\n        \"The way we greet others can depend on the situation. For example, in formal settings such as job interviews, people tend to use polite language and avoid physical contact. On the other hand, casual environments like family gatherings allow for warmer interactions, including hugs or kisses on the cheek. Understanding the difference between formal and casual greetings helps us navigate social situations smoothly.\",\n        \"Respect plays a big role in greetings too. In some cultures, younger people bow lower than elders to show deference. Similarly, addressing someone by their title (like 'Doctor' or 'Professor') demonstrates respect in professional contexts. Even something as simple as making eye contact while shaking hands can convey sincerity and trustworthiness.\",\n        \"So, the next time you meet someone, take a moment to consider the greeting.
