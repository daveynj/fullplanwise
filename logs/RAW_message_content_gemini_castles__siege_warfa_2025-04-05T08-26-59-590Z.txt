Write these on the board, categorizing them as 'castle defenses', 'siege weapons', 'siege tactics', or 'daily life under siege'. This activates prior knowledge and introduces key vocabulary organically.",

      "title": "Reading Text: The Siege of a Medieval Castle",
      "introduction": "This text describes a typical medieval castle siege, focusing on the strategies and challenges faced by both attackers and defenders.",
      "paragraphs": [
        "The year is 1346.  A mighty castle, perched atop a hill, stands defiant against the relentless assault of a large army.  Its stone walls, thick and imposing, have withstood weeks of bombardment.  The defenders, weary but resolute, man the battlements, their eyes constantly scanning the horizon for any sign of the enemy's next move.  Supplies are dwindling, and morale is beginning to waver.",
        "The attackers, a formidable force, employ a variety of siege weapons.  Massive catapults hurl boulders against the castle walls, attempting to breach the defenses.  Trebuchets, with their long arms and powerful counterweights, launch even larger projectiles.  Meanwhile, battering rams, wielded by scores of soldiers, relentlessly pound against the gates, hoping to force an entry.",
        "The defenders respond with their own tactics.  They pour boiling oil and hot sand down on the attackers, slowing their advance.  Archers, positioned strategically along the walls, rain down a hail of arrows, picking off the enemy soldiers.  They use ingenious traps and obstacles to hinder the progress of the siege engines.",
        "Days turn into weeks, and the siege continues.  The castle's defenses, though battered, hold firm.  The attackers are suffering heavy casualties, and their supplies are also beginning to run low.  Negotiations for surrender are attempted, but the castle's lord remains steadfast in his refusal to yield.",
        "Finally, after months of relentless fighting, a breach is made in the castle walls.  The defenders, exhausted and outnumbered, are forced to surrender.  The siege is over, leaving behind a trail of destruction and a stark reminder of the brutal realities of medieval warfare. The castle, once a symbol of strength and invincibility, now stands as a testament to the relentless power of a prolonged siege."
