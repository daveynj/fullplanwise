        "Family structures vary greatly around the world. In some cultures, extended families live together under one roof. This means grandparents, parents, and children all share daily life. Such arrangements can create strong bonds but also require careful planning. For example, everyone has specific responsibilities to keep the household running smoothly."
        :
        "Respect for elders is another important value in many societies. Elders are often seen as wise and experienced. They may play key roles in decision-making or pass down traditions. In some families, younger members bow or use special greetings to show respect. Can you think of ways your culture honors older generations?"
        ,
        "Gender roles also shape family dynamics. Traditionally, men might work outside the home while women manage household tasks. However, these roles are changing in many places. More families now share responsibilities equally between partners. What changes have you noticed in your community?"
        :
        "Traditions help maintain a sense of identity within families. Holidays, rituals, and customs connect people to their heritage. For instance, some families gather for large meals during festivals. Others celebrate milestones like weddings with unique ceremonies. How do traditions bring your family closer?"
        ,
        "Responsibility is a core value in every family structure. Whether it’s caring for younger siblings or supporting aging parents, everyone contributes. These duties teach important life skills and foster unity. Do you feel responsible for certain tasks at home?"
