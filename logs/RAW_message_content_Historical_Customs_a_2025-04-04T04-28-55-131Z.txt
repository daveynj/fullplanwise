Priests played a key role in these ceremonies, ensuring that every step followed strict rules. This shows us how much importance they placed on life after death.\",\":"

           "These rituals were part of a larger societal structure called a hierarchy. In Egypt, the Pharaoh stood at the top, followed by priests, soldiers, and farmers. Each group had specific roles, creating order in daily life. Similarly, Roman society also operated under a clear hierarchy, with emperors leading powerful armies and governing vast territories.\",\":"

          "Symbolism was another crucial aspect of ancient traditions. For instance, Greeks used olive branches as symbols of peace during the Olympic Games. Egyptians relied heavily on hieroglyphics, which combined pictures and symbols to tell stories. These visual elements carried deep meanings that connected people to their beliefs.\",\":"
