      "questions": [
        "Have you ever traveled by train? Where did you go?",
        "What are some advantages of traveling by train compared to other forms of transportation?",

Introduce the target vocabulary words: efficient, network, commuter, scenic, and convenient. Briefly explain each word's meaning and ask students to create their own sentences using each word in the context of train travel. For example, 'The train system is an efficient way to travel between cities.' or 'The train journey offered scenic views of the mountains.'\n3. Ask students to imagine they are designing a new train network.  Where would it go?  Would it be for commuters, scenic journeys, or both?  This helps connect the vocabulary to a practical scenario.",
      "teacherNotes": "Encourage students to use the vocabulary words in their responses.  If they struggle, provide additional examples and prompts.  This warm-up aims to activate prior knowledge and introduce key vocabulary in a fun, engaging way."

      "introduction": "From bustling commuter lines to luxurious cross-country journeys, trains have played a vital role in transportation for centuries.  Let's explore the enduring appeal of these steel giants.",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Trains offer a unique blend of efficiency, comfort, and scenic beauty. Unlike cramped airplanes or traffic-jammed highways, trains allow passengers to stretch out, relax, and enjoy the passing landscapes.  Imagine yourself gazing out the window at rolling hills, sparkling rivers, or snow-capped mountains.  It's a travel experience that engages all your senses.",
        "For commuters, trains provide a convenient and often cost-effective alternative to driving.  In many cities, extensive train networks connect various neighborhoods and suburbs, making it easy to get to work, school, or social events.  This reduces traffic congestion and contributes to a greener environment.  Think about how much time you could save by avoiding rush hour traffic!",
        "Beyond commuting, trains offer a unique way to experience the world.  Scenic train routes wind through breathtaking landscapes, offering passengers unparalleled views of natural wonders and charming towns.  From the Canadian Rockies to the Swiss Alps, these journeys are a feast for the eyes.  Have you ever considered taking a scenic train trip?",
        "Moreover, train travel can be a social experience.  You might strike up a conversation with a fellow passenger, share a meal in the dining car, or simply enjoy the camaraderie of a shared journey.  It's a chance to connect with people from different walks of life and create lasting memories."
