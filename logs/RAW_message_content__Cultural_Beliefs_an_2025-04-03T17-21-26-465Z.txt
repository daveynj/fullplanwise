      "procedure": "Begin by writing the target vocabulary on the board: 'extended,' 'respect,' 'gender roles,' 'tradition,' and 'responsibility.' Ask students to guess the meanings of these words based on their context. Next, provide simple definitions and example sentences for each word. For instance, say, 'An extended family includes grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins.' Then, ask students to use each word in a sentence. Finally, discuss how these words might relate to family structures in different cultures.",
      "teacherNotes": "Encourage students to share personal experiences or examples from their own families to make the vocabulary more relatable."

      "introduction": "This text explores how cultural beliefs shape family structures and roles, focusing on extended families, respect for elders, and gender roles.",
      "paragraphs": 
        "Families come in many shapes and sizes, but one common type is the extended family. An extended family includes not just parents and children, but also grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. In many cultures, living with extended family members is normal and even expected. This setup allows families to share responsibilities and support each other. For example, grandparents often help take care of grandchildren while parents work.",
        "Respect for elders is another important value in many societies. Elders are seen as wise and experienced, and their opinions are highly valued. In some cultures, younger family members bow or give a special greeting to show respect. This tradition helps maintain harmony within the family and teaches younger generations the importance of honoring their elders. Can you think of ways your culture shows respect to older people? It's fascinating how these practices vary around the world, isn't it? ,        "        :        "Gender roles have also played a significant part in family dynamics. Traditionally, men were often seen as breadwinners, responsible for providing financial support, while women took care of household duties and raised children. However, these roles are changing in many parts of the world. Nowadays, both men and women share responsibilities at home and in the workplace. This shift reflects broader societal changes toward equality and fairness.",
        "Family traditions are another way cultural beliefs influence family life. These traditions can include special meals, holidays, or rituals passed down through generations. They create a sense of belonging and identity for family members. For instance, celebrating Lunar New Year or Thanksgiving brings families together and strengthens their bonds. Do you have any family traditions that are particularly meaningful to you? Such customs remind us of our roots and connect us to our heritage."        :        "Finally, understanding family structures and roles helps us appreciate the diversity of human experiences. While every family is unique, they all share the goal of supporting and nurturing their members. Whether it's through respecting elders, sharing responsibilities, or upholding traditions, families play a vital role in shaping who we are. What aspects of your family structure do you value the most? Reflecting on this can deepen our appreciation for the ties that bind us."
