Begin by writing the five vocabulary words on the board: 'ritual,' 'hierarchy,' 'legacy,' 'symbolism,' and 'ceremonial.' 2. Ask students to brainstorm what they already know about each word. 3. Provide brief definitions and examples for each word (e.g., 'A ritual is a series of actions performed in a specific order, often for religious or cultural reasons'). 4. Engage students with questions like, 'Why might symbolism be important in ancient traditions?' or 'How does a legacy influence future generations?' 5.

One of the most famous examples is the construction of pyramids, massive tombs designed to protect pharaohs as they journeyed to the next world. These structures were not just architectural marvels but also carried immense symbolism, representing the sun god Ra and the eternal cycle of life. The process of mummification was another crucial ritual, ensuring that the deceased would retain their physical form in the afterlife.\",\n        \"In ancient Rome, social hierarchy played a central role in daily life. At the top were the patricians, wealthy landowners who held significant political power. Below them were the plebeians, ordinary citizens who often struggled for rights and representation. Despite these divisions, public ceremonies brought people together. For instance, gladiatorial games were ceremonial events that showcased Roman strength and entertained the masses. Such spectacles reinforced the values of bravery and loyalty within Roman society, leaving behind a complex legacy of both admiration and critique today.\\\",\\\",\" \n        :  \n      \"teacherNotes\" \n        ,\n    \"words\" \n      :\n    \"comprehension\" \n      ,\n    \"sentenceFrames\" \n      :\n    \"discussion\" \n      ,\n    \"quiz\" \n      :\n  \"sections\" \n} \n\n  \n  \n\n  ]\n\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n"
