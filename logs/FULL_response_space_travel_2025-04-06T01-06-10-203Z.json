For centuries, people dreamed of traveling beyond Earth. Today, thanks to advanced technology, astronauts can live and work in space for months at a time. They conduct experiments, repair satellites, and even grow plants in special environments without gravity. Imagine eating food that floats right out of your hand!\",\n        \"One of the most famous missions was Apollo 11, which landed humans on the Moon in 1969. Neil Armstrong became the first person to walk on the lunar surface, saying, 'That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.' Since then, many other missions have followed, including robotic explorers sent to Mars and beyond. These missions help us understand how planets form and whether life could exist elsewhere in the universe.\",\n        \"But space travel isn’t just about science—it also involves teamwork and courage. Astronauts train for years before going on a mission. They must learn how to handle equipment, survive in extreme conditions, and work together in tight spaces. Living in orbit means adapting to a new way of life where everything—from brushing your teeth to sleeping—happens differently due to microgravity.\",\n        \"Satellites play a crucial role in space travel and everyday life. Some monitor weather patterns, while others provide communication services like GPS navigation. Without these machines orbiting Earth, our modern world wouldn’t function as smoothly. Scientists continue to launch new satellites to gather data and improve our understanding of the cosmos.\",\n        \"So, would you want to become an astronaut?
