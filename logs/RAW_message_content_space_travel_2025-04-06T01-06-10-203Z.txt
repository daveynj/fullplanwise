      "questions": [
        "What do you think an astronaut does during a mission?",
        "How would you feel if you experienced zero gravity?",
        "Can you name any famous satellites orbiting Earth?",

      "procedure": "Start by introducing each word with its definition and example sentence. Use gestures or visuals to explain concepts like 'gravity' and 'orbit.' Then, ask students to match the words with their meanings. Next, practice pronunciation using the phonetic guide. Finally, discuss the questions above, ensuring all vocabulary items are used at least once.",

      "title": "Reading Text: The Wonders of Space Travel",
      "introduction": "Space travel has always fascinated humans. From early dreams of flying to the stars to modern missions exploring distant planets, this topic captures our imagination. Let’s dive into the exciting world of space exploration!",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Have you ever looked up at the night sky and wondered what it would be like to float among the stars? For centuries, people dreamed of traveling beyond Earth. Today, thanks to advanced technology, astronauts can live and work in space for months at a time. They conduct experiments, repair satellites, and even grow plants in special environments without gravity. Imagine eating food that floats right out of your hand!",
        "One of the most famous missions was Apollo 11, which landed humans on the Moon in 1969. Neil Armstrong became the first person to walk on the lunar surface, saying, 'That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.' Since then, many other missions have followed, including robotic explorers sent to Mars and beyond. These missions help us understand how planets form and whether life could exist elsewhere in the universe.",
        "But space travel isn’t just about science—it also involves teamwork and courage. Astronauts train for years before going on a mission. They must learn how to handle equipment, survive in extreme conditions, and work together in tight spaces. Living in orbit means adapting to a new way of life where everything—from brushing your teeth to sleeping—happens differently due to microgravity.",
        "Satellites play a crucial role in space travel and everyday life. Some monitor weather patterns, while others provide communication services like GPS navigation. Without these machines orbiting Earth, our modern world wouldn’t function as smoothly. Scientists continue to launch new satellites to gather data and improve our understanding of the cosmos.",
        "So, would you want to become an astronaut? While it sounds thrilling, it’s not easy. But who knows? Maybe someday, ordinary people will get the chance to visit space. Until then, we can dream—and maybe watch a rocket launch online!"
