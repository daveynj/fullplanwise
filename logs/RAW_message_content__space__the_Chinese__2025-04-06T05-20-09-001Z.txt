      "content": "In this warm-up, we will explore key vocabulary related to space exploration and the Chinese space program. You'll learn words like 'satellite,' 'orbit,' 'mission,' 'astronaut,' and 'launch.' These words are essential for understanding how China has become a major player in space exploration.",
      "questions": [
        "What do you think a 'satellite' is used for?",
        "Have you ever seen a rocket 'launch' on TV or online?",
        "What does it mean when something is in 'orbit' around Earth?",
        "Can you guess what an 'astronaut' does during a space 'mission'?",
        "Why do countries invest in space programs?"
      ],
      "targetVocabulary": ["satellite", "orbit", "mission", "astronaut", "launch"],
      "procedure": "Begin by showing images of satellites, rockets launching, astronauts in space, and objects in orbit. Ask students to describe what they see using simple language. Introduce each target word with its definition and example sentence. For instance, explain that a 'satellite' is an object sent into space to collect information. Then, ask students to match the vocabulary words with their meanings. Finally, discuss the questions as a group, ensuring all vocabulary items are used at least once.",
      "teacherNotes": "Encourage students to share personal experiences or knowledge about space exploration. Use visuals to make abstract concepts more concrete."

      "introduction": "China’s space program has grown rapidly over the past few decades. From sending its first satellite into space to planning future missions to Mars, China is now one of the leading nations in space exploration. Let’s take a closer look at some exciting milestones and achievements!",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Did you know that China launched its first satellite, called Dong Fang Hong 1, back in 1970? This was a huge step forward for the country. Since then, China has developed advanced technology to send not only satellites but also humans into space. Imagine being able to watch a live broadcast of a rocket launch—it’s truly amazing! Today, China operates many satellites that help with weather forecasting, communication, and even navigation systems like GPS.",
        "One of the most impressive achievements came in 2003 when Yang Liwei became the first Chinese astronaut to travel to space. His mission lasted just over 21 hours, but it marked the beginning of China’s human spaceflight program. Astronauts undergo years of training before they can go on such important missions. They must be physically fit, mentally strong, and ready to face challenges in space.",
        "In recent years, China has focused on exploring the Moon. In 2019, the Chang’e 4 spacecraft made history by landing on the far side of the Moon—a place no other country had reached before. Scientists hope to learn more about the Moon’s surface and possibly find resources that could benefit life on Earth. What do you think they might discover?",
        "Looking ahead, China plans to build a permanent space station called Tiangong, which means 'Heavenly Palace.' Construction began in 2021, and it will serve as a base for scientific experiments and international cooperation. Wouldn’t it be cool to visit a space station someday? Maybe in the future, people will take vacations in space!",
        "China’s space program shows us how much humans can achieve with determination and teamwork. While there are still many mysteries in space waiting to be solved, one thing is certain: China will continue to play a big role in uncovering them. So, what do you think the next big milestone will be?"
