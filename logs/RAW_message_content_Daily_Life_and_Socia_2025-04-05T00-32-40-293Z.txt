        "What is a custom you follow when meeting someone new?",
        "Can you think of a gesture that shows respect?",
        "When do you use formal language instead of casual language?",

      "introduction": "Greetings are more than just words—they are a way to connect with others and show respect. In this text, we’ll explore how people around the world greet each other and why these customs matter.",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Imagine arriving at a party where everyone greets you differently. One person shakes your hand firmly, another gives you a quick hug, and yet another bows slightly. Each of these actions is a custom—a tradition passed down through generations. While handshakes are common in many Western countries, bows are often used in places like Japan as a sign of respect. These gestures might seem small, but they carry deep meaning.",
        "The way we greet others can depend on the situation. For example, in formal settings such as job interviews, people tend to use polite language and avoid physical contact. On the other hand, casual environments like family gatherings allow for warmer interactions, including hugs or kisses on the cheek. Understanding the difference between formal and casual greetings helps us navigate social situations smoothly.",
        "Respect plays a big role in greetings too. In some cultures, younger people bow lower than elders to show deference. Similarly, addressing someone by their title (like 'Doctor' or 'Professor') demonstrates respect in professional contexts. Even something as simple as making eye contact while shaking hands can convey sincerity and trustworthiness.",
        "So, the next time you meet someone, take a moment to consider the greeting. Is it formal or casual? Does it involve a gesture? By paying attention to these details, you not only make a good impression but also honor the traditions of those around you."
