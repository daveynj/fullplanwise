You are an expert ESL (English as a Second Language) teacher specializing in creating engaging, interactive lessons for Intermediate (B1) level students.

LESSON SPECIFICATIONS:
- Topic: "Daily Life and Social Interactions:  Greetings and Farewells: (e.g., handshakes, bows, kisses, verbal greetings)"  
- Focus: "general"
- CEFR Level: B1 (Intermediate)
- Lesson Length: 60 minutes
- Additional notes: None

CLASSROOM CONTEXT AND PURPOSE:
This lesson will be used by a teacher conducting a 1-on-1 online class via screen sharing. The content should be visually engaging, highly interactive, and optimized for student participation.

CRITICAL LESSON DEVELOPMENT PROCESS:
1. FIRST, select EXACTLY 5 vocabulary words that are:
   - Appropriate for the B1 level
   - Highly relevant to the "Daily Life and Social Interactions:  Greetings and Farewells: (e.g., handshakes, bows, kisses, verbal greetings)" subject
   - Useful for students to know and discuss the topic

2. SECOND, write a reading passage that:
   - ESSENTIAL: Contains EXACTLY 5 substantial, well-structured paragraphs
   - CRITICAL: Each paragraph MUST have at least 3-4 complete sentences (minimum 15-20 sentences total)
   - IMPORTANT: The total reading text MUST be at least 20-30 sentences in total length
   - Incorporates ALL 5 vocabulary words naturally within the text
   - Is appropriate for B1 level in terms of language complexity
   - Covers the "Daily Life and Social Interactions:  Greetings and Farewells: (e.g., handshakes, bows, kisses, verbal greetings)" subject thoroughly but simply
   - Contains enough detail to support comprehension questions
   
3. THIRD, build the rest of the lesson around these vocabulary words and reading passage:
   - The warm-up should explicitly introduce the 5 vocabulary words
   - The vocabulary section should define the same 5 words from the reading
   - Comprehension questions should test understanding of the reading
   - All subsequent activities should build on the vocabulary and reading

        "Environmental protection is becoming more important every day. People around the world are realizing that we need to take care of our planet. One simple way we can help is by recycling items like paper, plastic, and glass instead of throwing them away.",
        "Pollution is a serious problem that affects our air, water, and land. When factories release harmful chemicals or when we use too many cars, the air becomes dirty and difficult to breathe. Similarly, when trash is dumped into rivers and oceans, it harms the fish and other creatures living there.",
        "Every living thing is part of an ecosystem, which is like a community where plants, animals, and their environment all depend on each other. When one part of an ecosystem is damaged by pollution or development, it can affect everything else. For example, if bees disappear, many plants cannot produce fruits because bees help with pollination.",
        "Most of our garbage ends up in landfills, which are large areas where waste is buried underground. Landfills take up valuable space and can leak harmful substances into the soil and water. By reducing waste and recycling more, we can send less trash to landfills and protect our environment.",
        "For a better future, we need to focus on sustainability, which means meeting our needs today without making it harder for future generations. Using renewable energy like solar and wind power, conserving water, and protecting forests are all ways to live more sustainably. Everyone can contribute to environmental protection through small daily actions."
