      "procedure": "1. Divide students into two teams.\n2. Write each vocabulary word on a separate slip of paper.\n3. One student from each team picks a word and acts it out without speaking.  For 'gesture,' they might wave or bow. For 'emotion,' they could show sadness or happiness. For 'express,' they might mime writing a letter. For 'encounter,' they could act out meeting someone unexpectedly. For 'significant,' they could point to a ring or a meaningful object.\n4. Their team tries to guess the word within a time limit.\n5. Teams take turns until all vocabulary words have been acted out.",

      "introduction": "Saying goodbye is a universal human experience, yet the ways we express it vary widely across cultures.  From a simple handshake to elaborate ceremonies, farewell rituals offer a fascinating glimpse into different cultural values and beliefs.  Let's explore some of these diverse customs and consider what they reveal about the societies that practice them.",
      "paragraphs": [
        "In some cultures, physical touch plays a significant role in farewells.  Think of the warm embrace common in many Latin American countries, or the traditional 'la bise' in France, where people lightly kiss each other's cheeks.  These gestures convey a sense of closeness and affection, emphasizing the importance of personal connection.",
        "Other cultures, however, prefer a more reserved approach.  In Japan, for example, bowing is the customary way to say goodbye, with the depth of the bow reflecting the level of respect and formality.  This practice highlights the value placed on politeness and social hierarchy in Japanese society.  Have you ever noticed how different greetings can be even within your own country?",
        "Beyond physical gestures, the words we use to say goodbye also carry cultural significance.  In some cultures, the phrase 'goodbye' implies a sense of finality, while in others, it's more common to say 'see you later' or 'until next time,' emphasizing the hope of future encounters.  These linguistic nuances reveal different cultural perspectives on time and relationships.",
        "The length and elaborateness of farewell rituals can also vary greatly.  In some indigenous cultures, farewell ceremonies can involve intricate rituals, songs, and dances, reflecting the deep bonds within the community.  These traditions underscore the importance of community and shared experience.",
        "From simple handshakes to elaborate ceremonies, farewell rituals offer a window into the rich tapestry of human culture.  By exploring these diverse customs, we can gain a deeper understanding of how people around the world express connection, respect, and the bittersweet emotion of parting ways."
