Let’s dive into the fascinating story behind their invention.\",\n      \"paragraphs\": [\n        \"Before watches existed, people relied on sundials, water clocks, and other rudimentary methods to track time. These early devices were far from precise and often impractical. Imagine trying to check the time at night or during cloudy weather! It wasn’t until the 15th century that portable timekeeping became a reality. The invention of spring-driven mechanisms revolutionized the way we measured time, paving the way for the first pocket watches.\",\n        \"The earliest watches were large, heavy, and not very accurate. However, as innovations in mechanics improved, so did the precision of these devices. By the 17th century, watchmakers had developed intricate mechanisms that could fit into smaller cases. This made watches not only functional but also fashionable accessories. Wealthy individuals began carrying pocket watches as status symbols, showcasing both wealth and technological advancement.\",\n   \"Fast forward to the 20th century, and watches underwent another transformation with the introduction of quartz technology. Unlike mechanical watches, which relied on springs and gears, quartz watches used electronic circuits powered by batteries. This innovation drastically increased accuracy while making watches more affordable and accessible to the general public. Today, smartwatches combine traditional timekeeping with modern tech, offering features like fitness tracking and mobile connectivity.\",\n        \"Despite all these advancements, one thing remains constant: our fascination with time. Whether it’s a classic analog watch or a sleek digital device, watches continue to play an essential role in our lives. They remind us of the importance of punctuality, productivity, and even style. So next time you glance at your wrist, take a moment to appreciate the centuries of innovation that went into creating that tiny marvel.\"\n      ],\n      \"teacherNotes\": \"Encourage students to highlight unfamiliar words and phrases.
