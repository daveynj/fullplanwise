      "paragraphs": [
        "Winston Churchill was born in 1874 and became one of the most important figures in British history. As Prime Minister during World War II, he showed incredible leadership. His speeches were not just words—they gave hope to people when things seemed darkest. Imagine living through bombings and constant fear, yet hearing your leader say, 'We shall never surrender.' Wouldn’t that make you feel stronger?",
        "Churchill understood the power of alliances. He worked closely with other world leaders, such as Franklin D. Roosevelt of the United States and Joseph Stalin of the Soviet Union. Together, they formed an alliance that helped defeat Nazi Germany. This teamwork proved how collaboration could change the course of history.",
5        "But Churchill wasn’t just about war. After the fighting ended, he focused on building a better future. He believed in resilience—the idea that no matter how hard life gets, we can recover and move forward. Today, his legacy lives on. People still quote his speeches and admire his determination. Churchill reminds us that even in tough times, courage and hope can lead the way."
      ],
      "teacherNotes": "Pause briefly after each paragraph to check comprehension. Highlight key phrases like 'never surrender' and 'building a better future' to emphasize Churchill's impact."
