      "questions": [
        "Have you ever seen a satellite in the sky at night?",
        "What do you think happens during a space mission?",
        "Why is technology important for exploring space?"

      "targetVocabulary": ["satellite", "orbit", "mission", "launch", "technology"],
      "procedure": "Start by asking students if they know anything about space exploration. Introduce each vocabulary word with its definition and an example sentence. Use visuals or gestures to clarify meaning. Then, ask the questions above to encourage discussion. For instance, show a picture of a rocket launch and ask what they think 'launch' means. Repeat this process for all five words.",
      "teacherNotes": "Encourage students to share their thoughts even if they're unsure. This builds confidence before the reading."

      "introduction": "Today, we’ll read about China’s exciting journey into space. Did you know that China has become one of the leading countries in space exploration? Let’s find out more!",
      "paragraphs": [
        "China’s space program began in the late 1950s, but it wasn’t until recently that it gained worldwide attention. In 2003, China became the third country to send a human into space using its own technology. Yang Liwei was the first Chinese astronaut to orbit Earth. His mission lasted just over 21 hours, but it marked a huge step forward for China’s ambitions in space.",
        "Since then, China has launched many satellites into orbit. These satellites help with weather forecasting, communication, and scientific research. One of the most impressive achievements was the Chang’e missions to the Moon. In 2019, China successfully landed a spacecraft on the far side of the Moon—a world first! Imagine being able to explore a part of the Moon no one had ever seen up close before.",
        "China also plans to build a permanent space station called Tiangong, which means 'Heavenly Palace.' Construction started in 2021, and astronauts have already begun living and working there. This space station will allow scientists to conduct experiments in microgravity, helping us learn more about life beyond Earth. Wouldn’t it be amazing to live in space someday?",
        "The Chinese space program shows how much progress can happen when people work together toward a common goal. From launching rockets to developing new technologies, every step brings humanity closer to understanding the universe. Who knows what discoveries lie ahead?"
      ],
      "teacherNotes": "Pause after each paragraph to check comprehension. Encourage students to connect the text to the warm-up vocabulary."
