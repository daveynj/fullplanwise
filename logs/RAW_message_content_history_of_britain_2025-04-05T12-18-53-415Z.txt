      "title": "Reading Text: A Journey Through British History",
      "introduction": "Britain has a rich and fascinating history that stretches back thousands of years. From ancient tribes to modern-day democracy, its story is full of drama, power struggles, and cultural achievements. Let's take a closer look at some key moments in British history.",
      "paragraphs": [
        "The history of Britain begins long before it was called 'Britain.' Around 2,000 years ago, the Romans arrived and built roads, walls, and cities like London. They stayed for nearly 400 years but eventually left. After the Romans, different groups such as the Anglo-Saxons and Vikings came to settle. Each group left its mark on the language, culture, and traditions of the land. Have you ever wondered why English has so many words borrowed from other languages? It’s because of these early settlers!",
        "One of the most important periods in British history was the Middle Ages. During this time, kings and queens ruled over a powerful monarchy. Castles were built, knights fought battles, and legends like King Arthur emerged. The Magna Carta, signed in 1215, was another major event during this era. It limited the king’s power and laid the foundation for modern democracy. Can you imagine living in a world where one person had absolute control?",
        "Fast forward to the 1600s, and Britain experienced a revolution. People grew tired of the monarchy’s rule and wanted more freedom. This led to the English Civil War and the execution of King Charles I. Later, in 1688, the Glorious Revolution established a constitutional monarchy, meaning the king or queen shared power with Parliament. These changes shaped how Britain is governed today.",
        "During the 18th and 19th centuries, Britain became the heart of a vast empire. Ships sailed across the globe, bringing back goods, ideas, and even new territories. However, not all parts of this empire were positive. Many countries suffered under British rule. Still, the empire played a huge role in shaping global trade and spreading the English language. Do you think the benefits outweighed the negatives?",
        "Today, Britain is known for its rich heritage and iconic landmarks. Places like Stonehenge, Buckingham Palace, and the Tower of London attract millions of visitors every year. While the monarchy no longer holds much political power, it remains an important symbol of national identity. What do you think the future holds for Britain?"
